# project2
Project consisting of a server and a client file in which the client file gathers data internally from the Pi and sends it over a network a total of 50 times once every 2 seconds.
Server receives the data and displays a GUI indicating data received with a blinking unicode "LED" that updates both the data and the "LED" everytime new data is received. The client also has a GUI component that shows a blinking unicode "LED" again but this time just to indicate it has a connection with the server.
